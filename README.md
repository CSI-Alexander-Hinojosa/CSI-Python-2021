# Course Description
#### By understanding Git and GitHub you will acquire access to most of the code humanity has developed. Fundamental understanding of computer programming will allow you to visualize concepts beyond some standard limitations of your brain. 

2 meetings per cycle
24 courses in semester
48 classes total
At least 300 points.

## Objectives
* Understand Git version control and branching.
* Be able to understand the core aspects and syntax of a programming language.
* Be able to read and write algorithms using Python.  
* Be able to iterate through multidimensional arrays.
