# Module 1: using Visual Studio Code

### Open visual studio code. your first task is to change your working directory to that of the course.

1. Go to File > Open Folder
2. Select the directory you cloned your repository into `(CSI-Python-2021)`. 

<br>

### The first thing you will see on the left-most side of visual studio code is the file system for the class.

### On the bottom of your screen is the console. Through here you may communicate directly with your computer's Operating System.

# Communicate with Console

### Lets start by navigating through directories 
<br>

> `dir` will Show contents of current directory
> 
> `cd ..` will go back one directory
> 
> `cd CSI-Python-2021` will bring you back to the project directory (Assuming you went back one directory in the step before)
>
> **(Hint)** After typing "`cd `" into the console you may hit the `TAB` key to run through the options available in the directory, or to autocomplete.
>
>`cd Modules\Module1` will move you from
`C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021` to `C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021\Modules\Module1`
