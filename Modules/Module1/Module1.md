# Set up your development environment

## Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Correctly`(1pts)`
### Run Python Installer
   - [X] Add Python to PATH

<br>

## Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) `(1pts)`

### Visual Studio works for both MAC and PC. Xcode runs on MAC. Use default settings. I personally prefer the Dark theme.

<br>

## Branch off the class repository `(2pts)`
Create a folder. You may name it whatever you please but i will use "Courses" as it is simple and descriptive.
This will be your root folder. This means it is the top-level containing folder. You may place it anywhere but i suggest using your Documents or Desktop folder. In here you will clone the repositories for any classes that use GitHub. Currently Java, Python and hopefully NovaTech.
* In Visual Studio
* Go to File > Open Folder
* Select your newly created directory

<br>

### Create a fork in your GitHub.
Forking a repository will create a copy on your GitHub account. You may freely alter this copy to take class notes and answer questions. These changes will only be reflected on **your** copy of the repository. You may also update your copy of the repository to reflect any changes i have made to the course without overwriting your individual changes.

<br>

### Visit the class repo and click on fork (top right)
https://github.com/CSI-Carlos-Cobian/CSI-Python-2021

<br>

### Clone the project into the Classes folder on your machine
1. Go to your `Source Control` tab
2. Initialize Repository if you have not done so.
3. Click on the 3 dots (your git menu)
4. Clone the forked repository.
   - Select `Clone from GitHub`
   - Alternatively, enter the fork URL with format: github.com/CSI-Name-Lastname/CSI-Python-2021
5. When prompted, select to open your new repo.

You may clone a repository without forking it, but only the owner may push changes to it. When you fork a copy it becomes your own. 

<br>

### Update your fork:
You may update your fork on GitHub. When your fork is out of date, a banner will show up.

<br>

To download these changes to your local repository
1. Go to your `Source Control` tab
2. Click on the 3 dots (your git menu)
3. Pull

<br>

Alternatively, you may update both simultaneously from Visual Studio by selecting.
1. `Source Control` > Branch > Merge Branch
2. Select `upstream/main`

<br>

### [Source Tree Git](/../../tree/main/Modules/SourceTree/Setup.md) **(Optional)** 

* #### Provides easier visualization of branches and history. 
* #### Requires many 3rd party authorizations
