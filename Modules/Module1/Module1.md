# Module 1: using Visual Studio Code

### Open visual studio code. Your first task is to change your working directory to that of the course.

1. Go to File > Open Folder
2. Select the directory you cloned your repository into `(CSI-Python-2021)`. 

<br>

### The first thing you will see on the left-most side of visual studio code is the file system for the class.
<img    src="VSLeftPanel.png" 
        title="Files available on the directory may vary from the time of the screenshot" 
        width="60%" 
        height="60%" />

<br>

### On the bottom of your screen is the Terminal. Through here you may communicate directly with your computer's Operating System. 
<br>
<img    src="Terminal.png" 
        title="Terminal" 
        width="90%" 
        height="90%" />

# Communicate with Console

## Lets start by navigating through directories 
### Type the following commands into your console


`dir` will Show contents of current directory
 
`cd ..` will go back one directory

`cd CSI-Python-2021` will bring you back to the project directory (Assuming you went back one directory in the step before)

**(Hint)** After typing "`cd `" into the console you may hit the `TAB` key to run through the options available in the directory, or to autocomplete.

`cd Modules\Module1` will move you from
> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021

to 

> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021\Modules\Module1

<br>

# Interact with Python.

Python should have been installed and added to PATH. To verify this run: `python --version` and recieve an output of:
 
>Python 3.9.6

<br>

## Open Python Console

`python` will enter the Python console that should look like:

> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>
> \>\>\>

`print("Hello World!")` will run a simple python command that returns whichever string of text you have encapsulated into your doublequotes.

`exit()` will bring you back into your Operating System's console.

<br>

## Execute Python Script
Navigate to the Module1 directory and type: `python HelloWorld.py`. This will execute a python script.

The output should look like the following:

<img    src="HelloWorldSample.png" 
        title="HelloCarlos!" 
        width="90%" 
        height="90%" />

#### Take a screenshot of your output and save it in the <u>Module1</u> directory of your branch. Name the file using your name and the following naming convention: `CSI-Carlos-Cobian-Module1-1.png`

<br>

## Answer the following questions on the MarkDown file located within your `Module1` directory (Module1.md). 

<br>

what?

 - answer

who?
