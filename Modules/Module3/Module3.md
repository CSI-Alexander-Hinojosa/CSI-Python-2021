# Module 3: Data Type

## Data type
A data type is a category for values. The most commons data types in Python are `integer`, `float`, `strings`, and `boolean`. 

<br>

### Integer
In Python, whole numbers are called `integers`. Programmers usually count using integers. 
>Example: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 14, 2019

<br>

### Float
In coding, numbers with a decimal point are known as `floats`. It's Full name is <u>Decimal Floating Point Number</u>. A `double`'s full name is <u>Double Precision Decimal Floating Point Number</u>(float64).  
>Example: -1.25, -1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.33

<br>

### String
Programmers use the word strings to refer to blocks of text or any data made up of a sequence of characters. Strings are a single data object; They are surrounded by single quote (') or double quote (") characters. 
>Example: "a", "aa", 'Hello!', '101 Dalmatians'

<br>

### Boolean
A Boolean is a value that is represented by a single bit. This means that it is either true or false. Booleans are used as a part of logic. Various operators may determine whether a statement is true or false such as equals(`==`) or greater than(`>`).
>Example:
>
>i = 10
>
>(i < 15) is False

<br>

### Object
You may define your own data type. In <u>object oriented languages</u> such as Java or C#, everything is an object.

<br>

### Null
A null or None type represents the absence of a value. This differs from, say 0, in that 0 is present value. 

<br>

### Array
An array is a list, or collection, of a certain data type. An array is treated as its own data type since it acts like a container.

<br>

## Data Types

| Data Type | Syntax | 
|-----------|--------|
|Integer | `i = 42` <br> `i:int = 42` <br> `i = int("3")` <br> converts a string with int characters into a number |
|Float | `d = float(5)` <br> is equal to 5.0 <br> `d = 5.3` |
|String | `s = "Hello World!"` <br> `s = str(42)` <br> is equal to "42" |
|Boolean | True, False, >, <, ==, >=, <=, 1, 0, and, or, not |
|Object | `o = Object()` |
|Void/Null | `o = None` |
|Array | `int[] integerArray = new int[5]` <br> initializes an empty(null) array of length 5 <br> `int[] arr = {4, 3, -1, 4, 34}`|

## Class Discussion
## Answer the questions on the Markdown file located within your <u>`Module3`</u> directory (Module3.md) - `(10pts)`

<!-- Welcome! These are your questions. -->
<!-- Answer using full sentences to receive all points. -->
<!-- 

What is the difference between "42" and 42.

 - Answer:

Define: >, <, ==, >=, <=

 - Answer:

How do you address an index in an array? Write a python code that assigns 34 to a new variable by accessing the value stored in:  
        int[] arr = {4, 3, -1, 4, 34}

 - Answer:

What is the first index of an array? Why?:  

 - Answer:

Provide an original example of a null in which you prove your understanding of the concept.

 - Answer:

Lackluster responses may result in point deductions.
