# Module 4: Data Type

## Data type
A data type is a category for values. The most commons data types in Python are `integer`, `float`, `strings`, and `boolean`. 

<br>

### Integer
In Python, whole numbers are called `integers`. Programmers usually count using integers. 
>Example: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 14, 2019

<br>

### Float
In coding, numbers with a decimal point are known as `floats`. It's Full name is <u>Decimal Floating Point Number</u>. A `double`'s full name is <u>Double Precision Decimal Floating Point Number</u>(float64).  
>Example: -1.25, -1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.33

<br>

### String
Programmers use the word strings to refer to blocks of text or any data made up of a sequence of characters. Strings are a single data object; They are surrounded by single quote (') or double quote (") characters. 
>Example: "a", "aa", 'Hello!', '101 Dalmatians'





| Data Type | Python | 
|----------|----------|
|Integer | i = 42 <br> i: int = 42 <br> i = int ("3")|
|Float|d = float(5) <br> d = 5.3|
