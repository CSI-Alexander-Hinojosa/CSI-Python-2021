# Module 3: What is Python?

### Open Visual Studio Code. Your first task is create your first algorithm in Python.

1. Select Module 3
2. Go to File > New File
3. Name the file as Print.py  
*Python programs usually have a name ending with ".py", which makes them easy to recognize. 

## `Print`
In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to talk. the message to be printed should be surrounded by brackets(`'` or `"`).
### Exercise 3.1 
Print your name using the print () command.
>Jos√© D. Quintana Rivera

<br>

## `Variables`
A variable can store a value.  In Python, programmers assign variables by using the equals `sign(=)`. 

Example: 

age = 21

print(age)

>21

### Ex. 3.2 Update the variable meal to reflect each meal of the day before you print it. 
>Breakfast: 

>An english muffing

>Lunch:

>Burrito with nachos

>Dinner:

>Spagettis with brocolli
<br>


# Communicate with Console

## Lets start by navigating through directories 
### Type the following commands into your console


`dir` will Show contents of current directory
 
`cd ..` will go back one directory

`cd CSI-Python-2021` will bring you back to the project directory (Assuming you went back one directory in the step before)

**(Hint)** After typing "`cd `" into the console you may hit the `TAB` key to run through the options available in the directory, or to autocomplete.

`cd Modules\Module2` will move you from
> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021

to 

> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021\Modules\Module2

<br>

# Interact with Python.

Python should have been installed and added to PATH. To verify this run: `python --version` and recieve an output of:
 
>Python 3.9.6

<br>

## Open Python Console

Typing `python` into the terminal will enter the Python console:

> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>
> \>\>\>

`print("Hello World!")` will run a simple python command that returns whichever string of text you have encapsulated into your doublequotes. In this case 
> Hello World!

`exit()` will bring you back into your Operating System's console.

<br>

## Execute Python Script
Navigate to the Module2 directory and type: `python HelloWorld.py`. This will execute a python script.

The output should look like the following:

<img    src="HelloWorldSample.png" 
        title="HelloCarlos!" 
        width="50%" 
        height="60%" />

#### Take a screenshot of your output and save it in the <u>Module2</u> directory of your branch. Name the file using the following convention: `CSI-Carlos-Cobian-Module2-1.png`

<br>

## Answer the following questions on the MarkDown file located within your `Module2` directory (Module2.md). 

<br>

what?

 - answer

who?

 - answer

where?

 - answer

<br>

### Save the file. Commit your changes by the end of the class. 

### Push the commit(s) into your student branch before the start of the next class.
