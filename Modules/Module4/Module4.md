# Module 4: Let's start coding

### Open Visual Studio Code. Your first task is create your first algorithm in Python.

1. Select Module 3
2. Go to File > New File
3. Name the file as Print.py  
*Python programs usually have a name ending with ".py", which makes them easy to recognize. 

## `Print`
In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to talk. the message to be printed should be surrounded by brackets(`'` or `"`).

<br>

## `Strings`
Programmers use the word strings to refer to blocks of text or any data made up of a sequence of letters.  In Python a string is surrounded by single or double quotes. 
### Exercise 3.1 
Print your name using the print () command.
>Jos√© D. Quintana Rivera

<br>

## `Variables`

A variable can store a value.  In Python, programmers assign variables by using the equals sign "`=`". 

Example: 
```c
age = 21

print(age)
```
>21

<br>

### Ex. 3.2 Create an algorithm with the variable *`meal`*. Update the variable meal to reflect each meal of the day before you print it. (6 points)

<br>

>Breakfast: 
>
>An english muffin
>
>Lunch:
>
>Burrito with nachos
>
>Dinner:
>
>Spagettis with brocolli

<br>

## `Concatenation`
The "`+`" operator doesn't just add 2 numbers, it can also "add" two strings.  Combining two strings is called *concatenation*.
