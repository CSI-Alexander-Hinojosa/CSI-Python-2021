# Module 4: 

### Open Visual Studio Code. Your first task is create your first script in Python.

1. Select Module 4
2. Go to File > New File
3. Name the file as Print.py  
*Python programs usually have a name ending with ".py", which makes them easy to recognize. 

## `Print`
In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to talk. the message to be printed should be surrounded by brackets(`'` or `"`).

<br>
### Exercise 4.1 
Print your name using the print() command.

## `Variables`

A variable can store a value.  In Python, programmers assign variables by using the equals sign "`=`". 

Example: 
```c
age = 21

print(age)
```
>21

<br>

### Ex. 4.2 Write a script that updates the variable *`meal`*. Update it to reflect each meal of the day before calling print(). (6 points)

<br>

>Breakfast: 
>
>An english muffin
>
>Lunch:
>
>Burrito with nachos
>
>Dinner:
>
>Spaghetti with brocoli

<!-- Sample Code. Create a file named FeedingCycle.py -->
<!-- 
meal:string =
print
meal
print

print

 -->



<br>



## `Concatenation`
The "`+`" operator doesn't just add 2 numbers, it can also "add" two strings.  Combining two strings is called *concatenation*.

<br>


## `Functional Strings`
A Functional String accepts variables or <u>code blocks</u> `{}` into the construction of a string. Functional strings and <u>string formats</u> are faster than concatenation. 

A functional string is denoted by a "f" before the string initialization. eg.
```c
s:str = f "Combine an existing {var} with a number such as: {1}"
```
