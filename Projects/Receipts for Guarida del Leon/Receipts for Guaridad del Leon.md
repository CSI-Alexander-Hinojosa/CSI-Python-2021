# Receipts for Guarida del Le贸n
With your knowledge of programming, we're going to build a script to help speed up the process of creating receipts for students that shop at Guarida del Le贸n. 

In this project, you will be storing names and prices of the Guarida del Le贸n catalog n variables.  You will process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal. 

## Let's start. 

1. Create a Python script name Receipts-Guarida-del-Leon.py.
2. Add the first item, the best sale item, the hoodie.  Create a variable called `lion_hoodie_description` and assign to it the following string: 
>Black soft hoodie. 50% cotton and 50% polyester.
3. After that, create a price for the hoodie. Create a variable `lion_hoodie_price` and set it equal to 45.00
4. Extend the inventory with 3 more items available in Guarida del Le贸n. Create a variable and assign to it a string with the item's description.  After that, create a variable and set it equal to its sale price.  You should have 4 variables with item's description and 4 variables with item's sale price. 
5. You should also calculate the sales tax and set it equal to .115. That is 11.5%. Name it `sale_tax`.
6. A student is making its purchase.  You should keep a running tally of his expenses by defining a variable called `student_one_total`. Since student one hasn't purchased anything yet, set that variable equals to 0 for now. 
7. You should also keep a list of the descriptions of things that students are purchasing.  Create a variable called `student_one_items` and set that equal to the empty string "".  You'll tack on the description to this as students make their purchase.

### Example output:
```python
Student One:

Items: Black soft hoodie. 50% cotton and 50% polyester. New Balance Backpack. From gym clothes and school supplies to personal electronics, the CSI Backpack can accommodate everything you need to keep up with your on-the-go lifestyle.

Student One Total:
$105.925
```
