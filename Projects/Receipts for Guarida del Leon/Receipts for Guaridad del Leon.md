# Receipts for Guarida del León
With your knowledge of programming, we're going to build a script to help speed up the process of creating receipts for students that shop at Guarida del León. 

In this project, you will be storing names and prices of the Guarida del León catalog n variables.  You will process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal. 

## Let's start. 

1. Create a Python script name Receipts-Guarida-del-Leon.py.
2. Add the first item, the best sale item, the hoodie.  Create a variable called `lion_hoodie_description` and assign to it the following string: Black soft hoodie. 50% cotton and 50% polyester.
3. After that, create a price for the hoodie. Create a variable `lion_hoodie_price` and set it equal to 45.00
4. Extend the inventory with 3 more items available in Guarida del León. Create a variable and assign to it a string with the item's description.  After that, create a variable and set it equal to its sale price.  You should have 4 variables with item's description and 4 variables with item's sale price.
